**🎯Python Projects**

Welcome to my playground, my workshop, and my personal growth tracker—all rolled into one. Every project here is a step forward in turning logic into magic and code into creation.

**🎮 What’s Inside?**

🔍 Explorations in Python fundamentals (with flair!)

🕹️ Game challenges that test logic and creativity (yes, including Blackjack!)

💡 GUI apps, automation scripts, APIs—you name it!

✨ Code that’s clean, clever, and sometimes chaotic (but always fun)

**📌 Why I Made This**

Because learning should feel like leveling up in the best video game you've ever played.

Because every day with Python sparks new ideas, new bugs 😅, and new ways to think.

Because nothing beats the satisfaction of seeing your code actually do the thing!

**📁 Structure**

Under Python-Projects repository > Project folders with code, README, and assets

Clear naming, helpful comments, and bite-sized projects

Built with love, coffee, and a sprinkle of curiosity ☕

**👨‍💻 About Me**

Hi, I’m Divjyot Puri! 🐍✨
