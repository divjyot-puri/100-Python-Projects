**3a - Pizza Cost Calculator**

**What I Learned**
**Conditional Statements:** If, elif, and else statements were used for decision-making based on user choices like pizza size, pepperoni preference, and extra cheese.
User Input and Data Handling: The input() function was used to collect and process user input. String input was converted to numerical values using float() and int() functions for calculations.
**Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Basic arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and division were applied to calculate the final bill.
**Formatting Output:** F-strings were used to display formatted output, such as the final bill amount rounded to two decimal places.

**Project Overview**
The Python Pizza Deliveries project allows users to customize their pizza order and receive a final bill calculation based on their selections.

**How It Works**
The program prompts the user for pizza size, pepperoni preference, and whether they want extra cheese.
The program then calculates the total cost based on these selections, applying different pricing for each size and adding extras for pepperoni and cheese.
Finally, it displays the calculated total bill to the user.

**Code Highlights**
Implementing if, elif, and else statements to determine the bill based on size, pepperoni, and cheese options.
Utilizing the input() function to get user choices.
Converting user input to the correct data type (float for bill, int for tip percentage and number of people) for calculations.
Applying the round() function to format the bill to two decimal places.
